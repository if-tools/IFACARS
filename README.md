## IFACARS

**IFACARS** is a desktop application that tracks your Infinite Flight
flights, logs them, and stores them, so you can keep a log of your 
flights with detailed performance and route. It also provides useful
graphical guidance while you fly, like Runway Guidance that displays
the runway you are on or Glideslope Guidance that displays your airplane
position on the glideslope.  

IFACARS is currently in its early development stage. Track the progress
with this Trello board: https://trello.com/b/iurSWioT/development-roadmap.
